The Between the Fjords research group has several projects that repeatedly survey the vegetation composition of plots over several years. In any such dataset there are inevitably problems, such as synonynms, mis-identifications (sterile _Carex_ are a particular problem), or accidental omissions.

We need to be able to identify these problems so we can try to correct them, but with over two hundred plots surveyed four or five times, each with about 20 taxa, it is a huge job.

To make the task easier, we developed turf-maps that plot each taxon per turf per year. Since other people probably have similar data, and would find our code useful, I'm going to show how we do it using some data from the [LandPress project](https://www.uib.no/en/rg/EECRG/95156/landpress) which studies how climate and land-use change affects biodiversity and natural resources in Norwegian coastal heathlands. 

```{r}
#| label = "setup",
#| message = FALSE
# load packages
library("turfmapper")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyr")
library("purrr")
```


For each 1m^2^ turf, vegetation cover is estimated on a percent scale, and presence/absence is recorded on a 4 x 4 sub-turf grid and reported in columns freq1--freq16. A sample of the data is included in the package

```{r}
#| label = "load-data"
data(heath)

heath |> head() |> 
  select(site:freq5) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

We need to reformat the data with `tidyr::pivot_longer()` to make put it into a long format suitable for plotting (see [this post](https://www.fromthebottomoftheheap.net/2019/10/25/pivoting-tidily/)) for more about `pivot_longer()`).

```{r}
#| label = "pivot-long"
heath_long <- heath |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = matches("^freq\\d+$"), # subplot presence-absence columns 
               names_to = "subturf", 
               values_to = "presence", 
               names_prefix = "freq", 
               names_transform = list(subturf = as.integer)) |> 
  filter(presence != "0") # only want presences

#first few columns
heath_long |> head() |> 
  knitr::kable()
```


The subturfs are counted from top-left of the turf like the words on a page. We need to map these onto row/column positions so we can plot them with `make_grid()`. 

```{r}
#| label = "sub-turfmap"
grid <- make_grid(ncol = 4)
plot_subturf_grid(grid_long = grid)
```

`make_turf_plot()` will plot the data from one turf over time. It is wrapped in an anonymous function so that the site and plot name can be added as a title.

```{r}
#| label = "one_plot",
#| fig.height = 10,
#| fig.width = 7

heath_long |>
  filter(plot == "10.1.") |>
  (\(x){ 
    make_turf_plot(
      data = x,
      year = year, species = species, cover = cover, subturf = subturf, 
      title = glue::glue("Site {x$site}: plot {x$plot}"), 
      grid_long = grid)
  })()
```

There are a few things than need checking here, for example, _Agrostis capillaris_ vs. _Agrostis sp_, _Festuca_, and _Rhytidiadelphus_.

# Multiple Subturf maps

There are lots of turfs, and I want to be able to print them all at once which I can do using `purrr::pmap()` to iterate over the data using `make_turf_plot()`. 

```{r}
#| label = "many_plots",
#| eval = TRUE,
#| fig.height = 11,
#| fig.width = 7,
#| warning = FALSE

x <- heath_long |> 
  # sort
  arrange(site, plot) |> 
  group_by(site, plot) |> 
  nest() |> 
  pmap(.f = \(site, plot, data){ 
      make_turf_plot(
        data = data,
        year = year, species = species, cover = cover, subturf = subturf, 
        title = glue::glue("Site {site}: plot {plot}"), 
        grid_long = grid)
      }) |> 
  walk(print) #print all maps
```

If the plots aren't large enough, change `fig.height` in the chunk options.
